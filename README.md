## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a generic interactive pluggable application for solving puzzles (i.e. [`8-puzzle`](https://github.com/biqar/puzzle-solver/tree/master/src/8-puzzle), `15-puzzle`,
[`n-queens`](https://github.com/biqar/puzzle-solver/blob/master/src/n-queens), `Sudoku`, [`graph-coloring`](https://github.com/biqar/puzzle-solver/tree/master/src/k-coloring) etc.) using different problem-solving techniques (i.e. informed search, uninformed search, hill-climbing search etc.).
Here by word `pluggable` we mean in solving puzzles user can independently decide the search strategy along with the 
custom heuristic functions. If needed, user can extend this project to device their own solution with a very low effort. 
Besides, this application is designed in a way that, it will be an easy-going platform for benchmarking any puzzles w.r.t. different
state space search strategy, optimization techniques and heuristic functions.

### Search Strategies
A search strategy is defined by picking the order of node expansion, Strategies are evaluated along the following dimensions:
* Completeness: does it always find a solution if one exists?
* Optimality: does it always find a least-cost solution?
* Time complexity: number of nodes generated
* Space complexity: maximum number of nodes in memory

Time and space complexity are measured in terms of
* b: maximum branching factor of the search tree
* d: depth of the optimal solution
* m: maximum length of any path in the state space (may be infinite)

### Uninformed Search Strategies
Uninformed search strategies use only the information available in the problem definition
* Breadth-first search
* Uniform-cost search
* Depth-first search
* Iterative deepening search

### Informed Search
Idea: give the algorithm “hints” about the desirability of different states. Use an evaluation function to rank nodes and select the most promising one for expansion
* Greedy best-first search
* A* search

### Heuristic Function
Heuristic function h(n) estimates the cost of reaching goal from node n

Relaxed heuristic functions
* Pattern Database Heuristics 
* Linear Conflict Heuristics
* Gaschnig’s Heuristics

## Project Structure
The project has several independent parts that we combine to work as a whole. Directory "core" contains two factory 
methods that produce the puzzle solver and heuristic instance based on the parameter passed. Puzzle solutions can be 
implemented in separate directory as we have done for [`8-puzzle`](https://github.com/biqar/puzzle-solver/tree/master/src/8-puzzle), 
[`n-queens`](https://github.com/biqar/puzzle-solver/blob/master/src/n-queens), 
and [`k-coloring`](https://github.com/biqar/puzzle-solver/tree/master/src/k-coloring) here. Heuristic implementations 
placed in the `heuristic` sub-directory under the corresponding puzzle. Directory "utils" all the utility methods that 
help other functions to operate.

Please keep in mind, this is an active project and project architecture may change without any prior announcement. 
But all the future updates will be maintained in a way so that the project integrity will ke kept, meaning you will not 
face any difficulty in building or running the project.

## How to Build

```
# go to project directory
$ cd puzzle-solver

# build the project
$ make clean && make
```

## How to Run

General run command:
```
./puzzle -problem {PUZZLE_NAME} \
-algo {ALGORITHM_NAME} -mode {MODE} \
-heu {HEURISTIC_METHOD} \
-initial {INITIAL_STATE_OF_THE_GAME} -goal {GOAL_STATE_OF_THE_GAME} \
-board_dim {DIMENSION_OF_THE_BOARD} -mx_sideways_move {MAX_SIDEWAYS_MOVE}\
-print_path {PRINT_INITIAL_TO_GOAL}
```

Here is the parameter definition,
1. **-problem:** Specify the puzzle name to solve, for example, [`8-puzzle`](https://github.com/biqar/puzzle-solver/tree/master/src/8-puzzle).
2. **-algo:** Specify the search strategy to solve the puzzle, for example, "A*", "bfs", "dfs", etc.
3. **-mode:** Specify the inner methodology for the search strategy, for example, "bi-directional" bfs, "stack-based" dfs, etc.
4. **-heuristic:** Specify the heuristic function you want to use, for example, "hamming", "manhattan", "euclidean", etc. [default: manhattan]
5. **-initial:** Specify the initial board setup for your puzzle
6. **-goal:** Specify the goal state of your puzzle
7. **-board_dim:** Board dimension, may use representing any square board
8. **-mx_sideways_move:** Maximum allowed sideways move in hill-climbing search
9. **-print_path:** Flag to indicate printing path if solution exist, accepts boolean string, i.e., "true" or "false".
10. **-file:** Input file containing large input data. For example, we keep the constraint graph needed by [`k-coloring`](https://github.com/biqar/puzzle-solver/tree/master/src/k-coloring) algorithm.
11. **-mcolor:** Maximum allowed color, value -1 means we need to find the chromatic number, value (>0) means we need to color the graph by using this number of colors.
12. **-mrv:** Flag to indicate whether we will apply heuristic Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) for selecting the next vertex to color.
13. **-degree_heu:** Flag to indicate whether we will apply heuristic Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) for selecting the next vertex to color.
14. **-lcv:** Flag to indicate whether we will apply heuristic Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) for selecting the next vertex to color.

## Motivation of Algorithm Mode
While implementing different algorithms for solving [`8-puzzle`](https://github.com/biqar/puzzle-solver/tree/master/src/8-puzzle) problem, we found some optimization techniques help the algorithms' 
to be more efficient. These techniques can be rigid or independent w.r.t. the algorithm itself. 
For example, bi-directional search technique is very common in the domain of searching algorithms and can be applied to 
a large number of algorithms. Bi-directional search launch two searches, one from the initial state to the goal state 
and another one from the reverse direction. The key benefit here is it help reduce the search space, as we know the 
search trees grow exponentially by their depth. From table 1, we can find that the bi-directional strategy generates at least 2x 
less nodes comparing to the original algorithms (i.e. Optimized BFS vs. Bi-directional BFS). Fig 1 give a brief idea about the 
state space reduction by bi-directional strategy while applied in BFS. We can also observe in some cases within some constraints 
the original algorithm fails to reach the goal, whereas applying bi-directional approach may help reaching the goal (i.e. 
DLS vs. Bi-directional DLS for input 5). This become possible due to the lower search space generated by bi-directional approaches.

Some techniques can be applied to very selective algorithms. For example, DFS is a very well known algorithm in the domain of 
state space search and can be implemented in recursive and non-recursive (stack based) way. The benefit of using stack based 
DFS is avoiding stack overflow due to excessively deep recursions.

## Heuristics Vs. Metaheuristics
H.E. Lehtihet's reply in [[3](https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_are_the_differences_between_heuristics_and_metaheuristics)]

```
Heuristics are problem-dependent techniques. As such, they usually are adapted to the problem at 
hand and they try to take full advantage of the particularities of this problem. However, because 
they are often too greedy, they usually get trapped in a local optimum and thus fail, in general, 
to obtain the global optimum solution.

Meta-heuristics, on the other hand, are problem-independent techniques. As such, they do not take 
advantage of any specificity of the problem and, therefore, can be used as black boxes. In general, 
they are not greedy. In fact, they may even accept a temporary deterioration of the solution (see 
for example, the simulated-annealing technique), which allows them to explore more thoroughly the 
solution space and thus to get a hopefully better solution (that sometimes will coincide with the 
global optimum). Please note that although a meta-heuristic is a problem-independent technique, 
it is nonetheless necessary to do some fine-tuning of its intrinsic parameters in order to adapt 
the technique to the problem at hand.

You might want to take a look also at the so-called hyper-heuristics that go a step beyond 
meta-heuristics. The particularity of hyper-heuristics is that their search space is not the 
usual space of the solutions but is rather the space of heuristics or meta-heuristics. Indeed, 
hyper-heuristics can be viewed as "heuristics to search for heuristics". There is also a slightly 
different category defined as "heuristics to generate heuristics".
